Greetings,
<br><br>
We are excited to announce that Favatron is officially ready to leave beta.
<br><br>
We have settled on a simple two plan approach. We will have a free plan with 4 hour check intervals and 7 day data retention. We will also have a $15/year plan (yep, per year!) with 15 minute check intervals, unlimited data retention, and some other bonus features.
<br><br>
So what does this mean for you? Your data will be retained until November 1st, 2014. For those that upgrade to the Eternal plan before that date, nothing will change. Those that opt to stick with the free plan will have any data older than 7 days removed.
<br><br>
While we understand sticking with the free plan, we appreciate those showing their support by upgrading to the Eternal plan. Think of it as buying us a latte once every 4 months.
<br><br>
You can learn more and upgrade <a href="https://favatron.com/upgrade">here</a>.
<br><br>
For those that referred 5 or more users, you will be upgraded automatically to the Eternal plan for a full year for free.
<br><br>
Thanks again for your support,
<br><br>
The Favatron Team
