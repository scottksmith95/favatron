# Favatron
Source code to the Favatron service previously on http://favatron.com

This source code is provided as is. It has some pieces built around being hosted on Microsoft Azure websites and web jobs. Most of it should just work with very little tweaking.

You will need to look at secrets.js and set your configuration values there locally or set your environment variables.

Some things that need to be done

1. Remove all reference to Readability since their API has bee deprecated.
2. Set something up to run the files starting with webjob_ 

I am very open to others managing this and will add you as collaborators will full access if you want. Just let me know. 

Enjoy!
